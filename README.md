## Introduction
Deep learning has been largely used in human tracking problem. Traditionally, we use bounding boxes to represent human position to train the algorithm. Due to the improvement of the latest pose detectors, such as OpenPose, promising person pose dectector has been gradually used by the academy. However, a large amount of training data is required by the training process. In this PoseSimulator, we aim to generate large quantity of simulated pose detector data. We implemented a Graphical User Interface to help the user.
